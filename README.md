Total Dissolved Solid Sensor (TDS Sensor)

Overview: 

What is a Total Dissolved Solid Sensor and why is it important? A TDS sensor is essentially an electrical charge meter. Two electrodes are equally spaced out at the tip of the sensor and dipped into liquor solutions. These electrodes measure the charge and convert it into PPM(milligrams per liter). Pure H20 will read 0 PPM, however, tap water contains low traces of charge due to microscopic alternate chemicals in the water. However, water with dissolved materials will read a much higher charge. This is because all dissolved solids have an electrical charge. This is helpful because it allows us to determine areas where more dissolved solids are present, and potentially help identify which type of solids are present based on the PPM reading.
